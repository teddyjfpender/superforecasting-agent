# Microsoft Teams Meetings

Use the Teams meeting pipeline when you want Superforecasting Agent to capture Microsoft Teams meetings as forecast evidence. The pipeline ingests Microsoft Graph meeting events, fetches transcripts first, falls back to recordings plus STT when needed, and delivers structured review notes to the forecast desk.

This page focuses on setup and enablement:
- Graph credentials
- webhook listener configuration
- Teams delivery modes
- pipeline config shape

For subscription renewal, go-live checks, and the operator worksheet, use the dedicated guide: [Operate the Teams Meeting Forecast Pipeline](/docs/guides/operate-teams-meeting-pipeline).

## What This Feature Does

The pipeline:
1. receives Microsoft Graph webhook events
2. resolves the meeting and prefers transcript artifacts first
3. falls back to recording download plus STT when no usable transcript is available
4. stores durable job state and sink records locally
5. extracts forecast-relevant claims, assumptions, decisions, and evidence candidates
6. can deliver review notes to Microsoft Teams and optional workflow sinks

Operator actions stay in the CLI. The `teams-pipeline` subcommand is registered by the `teams_pipeline` plugin. Enable it with:

```bash
superforecasting-agent plugins enable teams_pipeline
```

or set `plugins.enabled: [teams_pipeline]` in `config.yaml`.

Common commands:

```bash
superforecasting-agent teams-pipeline validate
superforecasting-agent teams-pipeline list
superforecasting-agent teams-pipeline maintain-subscriptions
```

## Prerequisites

Before enabling the meetings pipeline, make sure you have:

- a working Superforecasting Agent install
- the existing [Microsoft Teams bot setup](/docs/user-guide/messaging/teams) if you want Teams outbound delivery
- Microsoft Graph application credentials with the permissions required for the meeting resources you plan to subscribe to
- a public HTTPS URL that Microsoft Graph can call for webhook delivery
- `ffmpeg` installed if you want recording-plus-STT fallback

## Step 1: Add Microsoft Graph Credentials

Add Graph app-only credentials to `~/.superforecasting-agent/.env`:

```bash
MSGRAPH_TENANT_ID=<tenant-id>
MSGRAPH_CLIENT_ID=<client-id>
MSGRAPH_CLIENT_SECRET=<client-secret>
```

These credentials are used by:
- the Graph client foundation
- subscription maintenance commands
- meeting resolution and artifact fetches
- Graph-based Teams outbound delivery when you do not provide a dedicated Teams access token

## Step 2: Enable the Graph Webhook Listener

The webhook listener is a gateway platform named `msgraph_webhook`. At minimum, enable it and set a client state value:

```bash
MSGRAPH_WEBHOOK_ENABLED=true
MSGRAPH_WEBHOOK_PORT=8646
MSGRAPH_WEBHOOK_CLIENT_STATE=<random-shared-secret>
MSGRAPH_WEBHOOK_ACCEPTED_RESOURCES=communications/onlineMeetings
```

The listener exposes:
- `/msgraph/webhook` for Graph notifications
- `/health` for a simple health check

You need to route your public HTTPS endpoint to that listener. For example, if your public domain is `https://ops.example.com`, your Graph notification URL would typically be:

```text
https://ops.example.com/msgraph/webhook
```

## Step 3: Configure Teams Delivery and Pipeline Behavior

The meeting pipeline reads its runtime config from the existing `teams` platform entry. Pipeline-specific knobs live under `teams.extra.meeting_pipeline`. Teams outbound delivery stays on the normal Teams platform config surface.

Example `~/.superforecasting-agent/config.yaml`:

```yaml
platforms:
  msgraph_webhook:
    enabled: true
    extra:
      port: 8646
      client_state: "replace-me"
      accepted_resources:
        - "communications/onlineMeetings"

  teams:
    enabled: true
    extra:
      client_id: "your-teams-client-id"
      client_secret: "your-teams-client-secret"
      tenant_id: "your-teams-tenant-id"

      # outbound forecast review-note delivery
      delivery_mode: "graph" # or incoming_webhook
      team_id: "team-id"
      channel_id: "channel-id"
      # incoming_webhook_url: "https://..."

      meeting_pipeline:
        transcript_min_chars: 80
        transcript_required: false
        transcription_fallback: true
        ffmpeg_extract_audio: true
        prompt_profile: "forecast-evidence"
        require_forecast_labels: true
        notion:
          enabled: false
        linear:
          enabled: false
```

Meeting output should distinguish facts, estimates, rumors, assumptions, and decisions. It should suggest evidence or review actions, but it should not change a forecast probability unless an operator or forecast workflow writes an explicit ledger update.

## Teams Delivery Modes

The pipeline supports two Teams review-note delivery modes inside the existing Teams plugin.

### `incoming_webhook`

Use this when you want a simple webhook post into Teams without channel-message creation through Graph.

Required config:

```yaml
platforms:
  teams:
    enabled: true
    extra:
      delivery_mode: "incoming_webhook"
      incoming_webhook_url: "https://..."
```

### `graph`

Use this when you want Superforecasting Agent to post the review note through Microsoft Graph into a Teams chat or channel.

Supported targets:
- `chat_id`
- `team_id` + `channel_id`
- `team_id` + `home_channel` fallback for the existing Teams platform

Example:

```yaml
platforms:
  teams:
    enabled: true
    extra:
      delivery_mode: "graph"
      team_id: "team-id"
      channel_id: "channel-id"
```

## Step 4: Start the Gateway

Start the gateway after updating config:

```bash
superforecasting-agent gateway run
```

Or, if you run the fork in Docker, start the gateway the same way you already do for your deployment.

Check the listener:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8646/health
```

## Step 5: Create Graph Subscriptions

Use the plugin CLI to create and inspect subscriptions.

Examples:

```bash
superforecasting-agent teams-pipeline subscribe \
  --resource communications/onlineMeetings/getAllTranscripts \
  --notification-url https://ops.example.com/msgraph/webhook \
  --client-state "$MSGRAPH_WEBHOOK_CLIENT_STATE"

superforecasting-agent teams-pipeline subscribe \
  --resource communications/onlineMeetings/getAllRecordings \
  --notification-url https://ops.example.com/msgraph/webhook \
  --client-state "$MSGRAPH_WEBHOOK_CLIENT_STATE"
```

:::warning Graph subscriptions expire in 72 hours

Microsoft Graph caps webhook subscriptions at 72 hours and will not auto-renew them. Schedule `superforecasting-agent teams-pipeline maintain-subscriptions` before going live, or notifications will silently stop three days after any manual subscription creation. See [Automating subscription renewal](/docs/guides/operate-teams-meeting-pipeline#automating-subscription-renewal) in the operator runbook for scheduler, systemd, and crontab options.

:::

For subscription maintenance and day-2 operator flows, continue with the guide: [Operate the Teams Meeting Forecast Pipeline](/docs/guides/operate-teams-meeting-pipeline).

## Validation

Run the built-in validation snapshot:

```bash
superforecasting-agent teams-pipeline validate
```

Useful companion checks:

```bash
superforecasting-agent teams-pipeline token-health
superforecasting-agent teams-pipeline subscriptions
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to check |
|---------|---------------|
| Graph webhook validation fails | Confirm the public URL is correct and reachable, and that Graph is calling the exact `/msgraph/webhook` path |
| Jobs do not appear in `superforecasting-agent teams-pipeline list` | Confirm `msgraph_webhook` is enabled and that subscriptions point at the right notification URL |
| Transcript-first never succeeds | Check Graph permissions for transcript resources and whether the transcript artifact exists for that meeting |
| Recording fallback fails | Confirm `ffmpeg` is installed and the Graph app can access recording artifacts |
| Teams review-note delivery fails | Re-check `delivery_mode`, target IDs, and Teams auth config |
| Meeting output is too generic | Tighten the pipeline prompt so it names affected forecast ids, factual claims, assumptions, estimates, and suggested ledger actions |
