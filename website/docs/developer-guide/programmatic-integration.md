# Programmatic Integration

Superforecasting Agent ships three inherited protocols for driving the forecast desk from external programs: IDE plugins, custom UIs, CI pipelines, and embedded sub-agents. Pick the one that matches your transport and consumer.

| Protocol | Transport | Best for | Defined by |
|----------|-----------|----------|------------|
| **ACP** | JSON-RPC over stdio | IDE clients (VS Code, Zed, JetBrains) that already speak the [Agent Client Protocol](https://github.com/zed-industries/agent-client-protocol) | `acp_adapter/` |
| **TUI gateway** | JSON-RPC over stdio (or WebSocket) | Custom hosts that want fine-grained control of sessions, slash commands, approvals, and streaming events | `tui_gateway/server.py` |
| **API server** | HTTP + Server-Sent Events | OpenAI-compatible frontends (Open WebUI, LobeChat, LibreChat…) and language-agnostic web clients | `gateway/platforms/api_server.py` |

All three drive the same server-side agent core. They differ in wire format and which set of features they expose. Forecast lifecycle work should still write durable state through the forecast ledger.

---

## ACP (Agent Client Protocol)

`superforecasting-agent acp` starts a stdio JSON-RPC server speaking ACP. Used in production by VS Code (Zed Industries' ACP extension), Zed, and any JetBrains IDE with an ACP plugin.

Capabilities exposed: session creation, prompt submission, streaming agent message chunks, tool-call events, permission requests, session fork, cancel, and authentication. Tool output is rendered into ACP `Diff`/`ToolCall` content blocks the IDE understands.

Full lifecycle, event bridge, and approval flow: [ACP Internals](./acp-internals).

```bash
superforecasting-agent acp                  # serve ACP on stdio
superforecasting-agent acp --bootstrap      # print install snippet for an ACP-capable IDE
```

---

## TUI Gateway JSON-RPC

`tui_gateway/server.py` is the protocol the Ink TUI (`superforecasting-agent --tui`) and the embedded dashboard PTY bridge talk to. Any external host can speak the same protocol over stdio (or WebSocket via `tui_gateway/ws.py`).

### Method catalog (selected)

```
prompt.submit           prompt.background       session.steer
session.create          session.list            session.interrupt
session.history         session.compress        session.branch
session.title           session.usage           session.status
clarify.respond         sudo.respond            secret.respond
approval.respond        config.set / config.get commands.catalog
command.resolve         command.dispatch        cli.exec
reload.mcp              reload.env              process.stop
delegation.status       subagent.interrupt      spawn_tree.save / list / load
terminal.resize         clipboard.paste         image.attach
```

### Events streamed back

`message.delta`, `message.complete`, `tool.start`, `tool.progress`, `tool.complete`, `approval.request`, `clarify.request`, `sudo.request`, `secret.request`, `gateway.ready`, plus session lifecycle and error events.

### Pi-style RPC mapping

Every command in the Pi-mono RPC spec has a TUI-gateway equivalent:

| Pi command | Superforecasting Agent equivalent |
|------------|-------------------|
| `prompt` | `prompt.submit` (or ACP `session/prompt`) |
| `steer` | `session.steer` |
| `follow_up` | `prompt.submit` queued after current turn |
| `abort` | `session.interrupt` |
| `set_model` | `command.dispatch` for `/model <provider:model>` (mid-session, persistent) |
| `compact` | `session.compress` |
| `get_state` | `session.status` |
| `get_messages` | `session.history` |
| `switch_session` | `session.resume` |
| `fork` | `session.branch` |
| `ui_request` / `ui_response` | `clarify.respond` / `sudo.respond` / `secret.respond` / `approval.respond` |

---

## OpenAI-Compatible API Server

`gateway/platforms/api_server.py` exposes the forecast desk over HTTP for any client that already speaks the OpenAI format. Use it for a web frontend, a curl-driven control-plane task, or a non-Python consumer. It is an API entry surface around the desk, not a replacement for scoreable forecast lifecycle commands.

Endpoints:

```
POST /v1/chat/completions        OpenAI Chat Completions (streaming via SSE)
POST /v1/responses               OpenAI Responses API (stateful)
POST /v1/runs                    Start a run, returns run_id (202)
GET  /v1/runs/{id}               Run status
GET  /v1/runs/{id}/events        SSE stream of lifecycle events
POST /v1/runs/{id}/approval      Resolve a pending approval
POST /v1/runs/{id}/stop          Interrupt the run
GET  /v1/capabilities            Machine-readable feature flags
GET  /v1/models                  Lists superforecasting-agent or the active profile name
GET  /health, /health/detailed
```

Setup, headers (`X-Hermes-Session-Id`, `X-Hermes-Session-Key`), and frontend wiring: [API Server](../user-guide/features/api-server).

## Which one should I use?

- **You're writing an IDE plugin and the IDE already speaks ACP** → ACP. Zero protocol work on the IDE side.
- **You're writing a custom desktop / web / TUI host and want the richest runtime feature set** (slash commands, approvals, clarify, multi-agent, session branching) → TUI gateway JSON-RPC.
- **You want any OpenAI-compatible frontend, a language-agnostic HTTP client, or curl-driven automation** → API server.
- **You want a Python in-process embed without a subprocess** → import `run_agent.AIAgent` directly. See [Agent Loop](./agent-loop).

---

## Model hot-swapping

Mid-session model switching works on every surface — it's the `/model` slash command under the hood.

- **CLI / TUI:** `/model claude-sonnet-4` or `/model openrouter:anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6`
- **TUI gateway RPC:** `command.dispatch` with `{"command": "/model claude-sonnet-4"}`
- **ACP:** the IDE sends the slash command as a prompt; the agent dispatches it
- **API server:** include a `model` field for OpenAI client compatibility; the actual provider/model is configured server-side

Provider-aware resolution (the same model name picks the right format for whatever provider you're on) is built in. See `hermes_cli/model_switch.py`.

---

## A note on `--mode rpc`

Superforecasting Agent does not have a `--mode rpc` flag. The three protocols above already cover the use cases: ACP for IDE-protocol clients, the TUI gateway for stdio JSON-RPC hosts, and the API server for HTTP.
