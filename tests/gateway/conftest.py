"""Shared fixtures for gateway tests.

The ``_ensure_telegram_mock`` helper guarantees that a minimal mock of
the ``telegram`` package is registered in :data:`sys.modules` **before**
any test file triggers ``from gateway.platforms.telegram import ...``.

Without this, ``pytest-xdist`` workers that happen to collect
``test_telegram_caption_merge.py`` (bare top-level import, no per-file
mock) first will cache ``ChatType = None`` from the production
ImportError fallback, causing 30+ downstream test failures wherever
``ChatType.GROUP`` / ``ChatType.SUPERGROUP`` is accessed.

Individual test files may still call their own ``_ensure_telegram_mock``
— it short-circuits when the mock is already present.

Plugin-adapter anti-pattern guard
---------------------------------
Tests for platform plugins (``plugins/platforms/<name>/adapter.py``)
must load the adapter via
:func:`tests.gateway._plugin_adapter_loader.load_plugin_adapter`, not by
adding the plugin directory to ``sys.path`` and doing a bare
``from adapter import ...``. The guard at the bottom of this file
scans test module ASTs at collection time and fails collection with a
pointer to the helper if the anti-pattern is detected.

Rationale: every plugin ships its own ``adapter.py``, and two tests each
inserting their plugin dir on ``sys.path[0]`` race for
``sys.modules["adapter"]`` in the same xdist worker. Whichever collects
first wins; the other fails with ``ImportError``, and the polluted
``sys.path`` cascades into unrelated tests. See PR #17764 for the
incident.
