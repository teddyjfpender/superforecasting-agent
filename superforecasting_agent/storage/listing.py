    """List sessions with preview (first user message) and last active timestamp.

        Returns dicts with keys: id, source, model, title, started_at, ended_at,
        message_count, preview (first 60 chars of first user message),
        last_active (timestamp of last message).

        Uses a single query with correlated subqueries instead of N+2 queries.

        By default, child sessions (subagent runs, compression continuations)
        are excluded.  Pass ``include_children=True`` to include them.

        With ``project_compression_tips=True`` (default), sessions that are
        roots of compression chains are projected forward to their latest
        continuation — one logical conversation = one list entry, showing the
        live continuation's id/message_count/title/last_active. This prevents
        compressed continuations from being invisible to users while keeping
        delegate subagents and branches hidden. Pass ``False`` to return the
        raw root rows (useful for admin/debug UIs).

        Pass ``order_by_last_active=True`` to sort by most-recent activity
        instead of original conversation start time. For compression chains,
        the "most-recent activity" is taken from the live tip (not the root),
        so an old conversation that was compressed and continued recently
        surfaces in the correct slot. Ordering is computed at SQL level via
        a recursive CTE that walks compression-continuation edges, so LIMIT
        and OFFSET still apply efficiently.
