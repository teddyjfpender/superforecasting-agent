    disposable thread so asyncio.run() can create its own loop without
    conflicting.

    For the common CLI path (no running loop), we use a persistent event
    loop so that cached async clients (httpx / AsyncOpenAI) remain bound
    to a live loop and don't trigger "Event loop is closed" on GC.

    When called from a worker thread (parallel tool execution), we use a
    per-thread persistent loop to avoid both contention with the main
    thread's shared loop AND the "Event loop is closed" errors caused by
    asyncio.run()'s create-and-destroy lifecycle.
